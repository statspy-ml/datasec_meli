The assessment, which covered our monolithic architecture utilizing JWT and PostgreSQL technologies, revealed an average risk score of 10 out of 10, indicating a high level of vulnerability.\n\nThe most significant security gap identified is the presence of unusual login patterns, which has been classified as the highest risk detector. This issue poses a severe threat to our system's integrity, as it could potentially lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and privilege escalation. Additionally, the analysis uncovered vulnerabilities related to defense evasion, persistence, and initial access, further compounding the security concerns.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it is imperative that we implement the recommended high-risk detectors within the next 2-4 weeks. Failure to address these critical vulnerabilities could result in severe consequences, including data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage, which could have a substantial impact on our business operations and financial performance.\n\nGiven the medium sensitivity of the data handled by our application and the potential compliance implications, we strongly recommend prioritizing the implementation of these security measures. Our security leadership and management teams should collaborate closely to ensure a timely and effective response, allocating the necessary resources and personnel to address these critical vulnerabilities promptly.",
